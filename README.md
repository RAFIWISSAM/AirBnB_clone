# AirBnB_clone
AUTHORS: WISSAM RAFI COLLABORATOR: KHAOULA RAJA

Project: 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

Description: In this team project, we supposed to write a command interpreter to manage our AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building our first full web application: the AirBnB clone. 
This first step is very important because we will use what we build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integrationâ€¦

This project should be done by using everything we have learned so far from : Python, OOP ...

Teamwork of two persons makes something better and understandable by dealing with 10 mandatory tasks plus 7 ones.

P.S: Always remember, At ALX SE you never learn the solution, you learn how to walk toward the solution.
